# Welcome to Programming Lightning: Building A Lightning Node

The goal of Programming Lightning is to give you hands-on development experience with Lightning. During this workshop, we'll build a full Lightning node with the help of the Lightning Development Kit (LDK). As you'll see during this workshop, the beauty of LDK is that it is fully customizable - you can choose where to souce your on-chain data from (full node, esplora, electrum, etc.), you data storage (filesystem, SQL database, etc.), and so much more. As we work through building a node, we'll discuss the various options and their trade-offs. Buckle up, this is going to be fun!

# Prerequisites

#### Bitcoin/Lightning
We assume you have read or already understand the information contained in **Mastering Lightning**. While we will cover some of the Lightning protocol in this course, most of the course focuses on applying that knowledge towards building a node with LDK, so a general understanding of Lightning will greatly help.

#### Rust
This workshop is entirely written in the Rust programming language. We will mostly be using the **Lightning Development Kit**, with a little bit of help from the **Bitcoin Development Kit** . If you're not familiar with Rust, there is a brief Rust Crash Course at the begining of this workbook. However, if you want to get the most out of this workbook, it is highly recommended to complete the following free, self-paced course first:
- [The Bitcoiner's Intro to Rust](https://btcdemy.thinkific.com/)

# Replit

Programming Lightning is self-contained, and everything you need is already implemented within this Repl. As we work through this course, we'll compelete small coding exercises which implement the missing pieces to our full LDK Lightning node, also contained within this workbook.

# Using the Workshop

Along the way you might come across emojis that signify something important. Whenever you see a lightning bolt (⚡️), then it's time to start a programming exericse.
