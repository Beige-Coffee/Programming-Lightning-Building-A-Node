# Solutions Directory

This directory contains solution files for the exercises. Each solution file is named with the pattern:
`original_filename.solution.rs`

For example:
- bitcoind_client.rs -> bitcoind_client.rs.solution
- sweep.rs -> sweep.rs.solution

Students should implement their solutions in the main src directory, while these files serve as reference implementations.
